            The Solar System[d] is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun
            and the objects that orbit it.[11] It formed about 4.6 billion years
            ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, forming the
            Sun and a protoplanetary disc. The Sun is a typical star that
            maintains a balanced equilibrium by the fusion of hydrogen into
            helium at its core, releasing this energy from its outer
            photosphere. Astronomers classify it as a G-type main-sequence star.
            The largest objects that orbit the Sun are the eight planets. In
            order from the Sun, they are four terrestrial planets (Mercury,
            Venus, Earth and Mars); two gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn); and two
            ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). All terrestrial planets have solid
            surfaces. Inversely, all giant planets do not have a definite
            surface, as they are mainly composed of gases and liquids. Over
            99.86% of the Solar System's mass is in the Sun and nearly 90% of
            the remaining mass is in Jupiter and Saturn. There is a strong
            consensus among astronomers[e] that the Solar System has at least
            nine dwarf planets: Ceres, Orcus, Pluto, Haumea, Quaoar, Makemake,
            Gonggong, Eris, and Sedna. There are a vast number of small Solar
            System bodies, such as asteroids, comets, centaurs, meteoroids, and
            interplanetary dust clouds. Some of these bodies are in the asteroid
            belt (between Mars's and Jupiter's orbit) and the Kuiper belt (just
            outside Neptune's orbit).[f] Six planets, seven dwarf planets, and
            other bodies have orbiting natural satellites, which are commonly
            called 'moons'. The Solar System is constantly flooded by the Sun's
            charged particles, the solar wind, forming the heliosphere. Around
            75–90 astronomical units from the Sun,[g] the solar wind is halted,
            resulting in the heliopause. This is the boundary of the Solar
            System to interstellar space. The outermost region of the Solar
            System is the theorized Oort cloud, the source for long-period
            comets, extending to a radius of 2,000–200,000 AU. The closest star
            to the Solar System, Proxima Centauri, is 4.25 light-years (269,000
            AU) away. Both stars belong to the Milky Way galaxy. Formation and
            evolution Main article: Formation and evolution of the Solar System
            Past Diagram of the early Solar System's protoplanetary disk, out of
            which Earth and other Solar System bodies formed The Solar System
            formed at least 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational
            collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud.[b] This initial
            cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed
            several stars.[14] As is typical of molecular clouds, this one
            consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of
            heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars.[15] As the
            pre-solar nebula[15] collapsed, conservation of angular momentum
            caused it to rotate faster. The center, where most of the mass
            collected, became increasingly hotter than the surroundings.[14] As
            the contracting nebula spun faster, it began to flatten into a
            protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200 AU[14][16] and a
            hot, dense protostar at the center.[17][18] The planets formed by
            accretion from this disc,[19] in which dust and gas gravitationally
            attracted each other, coalescing to form ever larger bodies.
            Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System,
            but they either merged or were destroyed or ejected, leaving the
            planets, dwarf planets, and leftover minor bodies.[20][21] Due to
            their higher boiling points, only metals and silicates could exist
            in solid form in the warm inner Solar System close to the Sun
            (within the frost line). They eventually formed the rocky planets of
            Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Because these refractory materials
            only comprised a small fraction of the solar nebula, the terrestrial
            planets could not grow very large.[20] The giant planets (Jupiter,
            Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the frost
            line, the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where
            material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid.
            The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the
            metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets,
            allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of
            hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements.[20]
            Leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions
            such as the asteroid belt, Kuiper belt, and Oort cloud.[20] Within
            50 million years, the pressure and density of hydrogen in the center
            of the protostar became great enough for it to begin thermonuclear
            fusion.[22] As helium accumulates at its core, the Sun is growing
            brighter;[23] early in its main-sequence life its brightness was 70%
            that of what it is today.[24] The temperature, reaction rate,
            pressure, and density increased until hydrostatic equilibrium was
            achieved: the thermal pressure counterbalancing the force of
            gravity. At this point, the Sun became a main-sequence star.[25]
            Solar wind from the Sun created the heliosphere and swept away the
            remaining gas and dust from the protoplanetary disc into
            interstellar space.[23] Following the dissipation of the
            protoplanetary disk, the Nice model proposes that gravitational
            encounters between planetisimals and the gas giants caused each to
            migrate into different orbits. This led to dynamical instability of
            the entire system, which scattered the planetisimals and ultimately
            placed the gas giants in their current positions. During this
            period, the grand tack hypothesis suggests that a final inward
            migration of Jupiter dispersed much of the asteroid belt, leading to
            the Late Heavy Bombardment of the inner planets.[26][27]
